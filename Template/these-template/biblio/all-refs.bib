Each cell can then be used in a run-time reconfigurable processor extension. Our method uses constraint programming to define the pattern merging problem and therefore can easily include design constraints and optimize different design aspects. Experiments carried out on Media-Bench test suite indicate 50\% average reduction of cell area without increasing critical path.}},

    abstract = {{Memory requirement estimation is an important issue in the development of embedded systems, since memory directly influences performance, cost and power consumption. It is therefore crucial to have tools that automatically compute accurate estimates of the memory requirements of programs to better control the development process and avoid some catastrophic execution exceptions. Many important memory issues can be expressed as the problem of maximizing a parametric polynomial defined over a parametric convex domain. Bernstein expansion is a technique that has been used to compute upper bounds on polynomials defined over intervals and parametric "boxes". In this paper, we propose an extension of this theory to more general parametric convex domains and illustrate its applicability to the resolution of memory issues with several application examples.}},

    title = {Simplification of Boolean Affine Formulas},
    author = {Feautrier, Paul},
    abstract = {{Boolean Affine Formulas, in which affine inequalities are combined by boolean connectives, are ubiquitous in computer science: static analysis, code and hardware generation, symbolic model checking and many other techniques use them as a compact representation of large or infinite sets. Common algorithms tend to generate large and highly redundant formulas, hence the necessity of a simplifier for keeping the overall complexity under control. Simplification is a difficult problem, at least as hard as SMT solving, with a worst case complexity exponential in the number of affine inequalities. This paper proposes a new method, based on path cutting in Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams, which is able to take advantage of any regularity in the subject formula to speed up simplification. The method has been implemented and was tested on benchmarks from several application domains.}},

	purpose, we need to find a generic way to express program transformations
	and compositions of transformations. In this article, we introduce
	a framework for the polyhedral representation of a wide range of
	program transformations in a unified and generic way. We also show
	that it is possible to generate efficient code after the application
	of polyhedral program transformations. Finally, we demonstrate an

	generation techniques in the Open64/ORC compiler.}},
