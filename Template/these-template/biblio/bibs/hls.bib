Each cell can then be used in a run-time reconfigurable processor extension. Our method uses constraint programming to define the pattern merging problem and therefore can easily include design constraints and optimize different design aspects. Experiments carried out on Media-Bench test suite indicate 50\% average reduction of cell area without increasing critical path.}},
